#### Is Loadshift Transport System a freight company?
No. Loadshift is an online marketplace that brings buyers and sellers of transport services together.

#### What happens after I complete & submit a request for quotation?
Your request for quotation will then be alerted (by SMS & email) to the members of the Loadshift System. Transport companies capable of servicing your request will directly contact you to offer quotation.

#### Is Loadshift Transport System responsible for the actions of any transport provider subscribing to its service, or any person/company requesting transport?
No.

#### What is the “Truck Availability Register”?
This is where heavy transport providers can register where and when their trucks will be available. People/companies requiring transport can then search this register for a truck that may becoming available in their required area.

#### Why do transport companies need to supply an Australian Business Number when registering for Loadshift Membership?
We require your ABN for two reasons. The first is that this service is intended to be for the benefit of Transport Companies. Therefore, a transport company must quote an ABN to be eligible for Loadshift membership. The second is to prevent unethical people from abusing the system. Loadshift will use the ABN to ensure the company details are accurate, and check trading history. Loadshift will always do what it can to protect our users.

#### How long does my request for quotation stay on the Loadshift Quote Request Notice Board?
When completing the form to request a quote, there is a box that permits you to state the date by which you require the quote. Your request for quotation will stay on the notice board until this date. Also, upon submitting a request for quotation a confirmation e-mail link is sent to your inbox.
