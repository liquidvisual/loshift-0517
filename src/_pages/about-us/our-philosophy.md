## The best way to be successful, is to build a respected reputation.

There is no more a reliable way to do this than by treating others in the same manner that you would like to be treated.

Or, as we say here at Loadshift...

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>"Truck unto others,
as you would have them
Truck unto you."</p>
</blockquote>

While Loadshift does not participate in anyone's business transactions, we do administrate the usage of this site with this philosophy in mind.

If conducting business in this manner is too high a standard for anyone, please re-consider your participation.

To make a report or to compliment someone's actions/service, please use our [Contact Us](/contact-us/) page.

Our _"Truck Unto Others"_ stickers are freely available. If you would like one, please email us and we would be happy to post.
